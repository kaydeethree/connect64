Android Assignment 3: Connect64

Checkstyle issues:
* Something something array initialization and switch indents.
* this.localField is ok, but the Source Cleanup tool removes "this" on method
  calls defined elsewhere in the Class, including those calls as part of an
  assignment operation. Checkstyle doesn't seem to care about methods defined
  in parent Classes or straight calls to class-defined methods though...
* It's also complaining about the 5 values I'm checking against in
  hasValidNeighbors(), (hasNext = 64 || up || down || left || right) but I
  don't want to break it up just to satisfy checkstyle as it's obvious what's
  going on.
* Interface-defined methods with >4 parameters aren't liked either, but there's
  nothing I can do about that.



BIG BIG IMPLEMENTATION NOTE: (this is my wow factor)


* I am using a library for the color picker. If it's not in the zip, it can be
  found at <http://code.google.com/p/android-color-picker/>. More info on at 
  https://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject
  
Other implementation notes:
* Serialization/Parcelization is painful. I'm really curious to see how the
  rest of the class saves state in onPause().
* I've got a boatload of member fields this time around, most of which are
  static tags or references to Views. Only 7 actual state members...
* I keep wanting to factor all of the game logic out into another class since
  the game state's all localized into the seven fields (and leave the GUI
  handling where it is...) but I'm worried about the performance hit of calling
  across classes all the time.
