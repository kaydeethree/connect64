Android Assignment 3: Connect64

Checkstyle issues:
* Something something array initialization and switch indents.
* this.localField is ok, but the Source Cleanup tool removes "this" on method
  calls defined elsewhere in the Class. Checkstyle doesn't seem to care about
  methods defined in parent Classes or straight calls to methods (that is, not
  calls as part of an assignment operation), though...

Implementation notes:
* The solution I came up with storing puzzles is meh. 2-dimensional arrays are
  not efficient, but at least they only get accessed _once_ on puzzle
  initialization. I'd store them as HashMaps (or SparseIntArrays on Android)
  if there was a better way to initialize them without having to iterate
  through the array to load them up anyway.
* It'd be nice if more Android-defined classes (like SparseIntArray) could be
  put in Bundles/saved preferences, but oh well.
* I've got a boatload of member fields this time around, most of which are
  static tags or references to Views. Only 7 actual state members...
