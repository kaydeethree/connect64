Android Assignment 3: Connect64

Checkstyle issues:
* Something something array initialization and switch indents.
* this.localField is ok, but the Source Cleanup tool removes "this" on method
  calls defined elsewhere in the Class. Checkstyle doesn't seem to care about
  methods defined in parent Classes or straight calls to methods (that is, not
  calls as part of an assignment operation), though...

Implementation notes:
* The solution I came up with storing puzzles is meh. 2-dimensional arrays are
  not efficient, but at least they only get accessed _once_ on puzzle
  initialization. I'd store them as HashMaps (or SparseIntArrays on Android)
  if there was a better way to initialize them without having to iterate
  through the array to load them up anyway.
* Serialization/Parcelization is painful. I'm really curious to see how the
  rest of the class saves state in onPause().
* onPause/Resume() and onSave/RestoreInstanceState() do nearly the same thing.
  I could generalize them to both stuff into preferences, but I'd rather not
  suffer the serialization hit.
* I've got a boatload of member fields this time around, most of which are
  static tags or references to Views. Only 7 actual state members...
* I keep wanting to factor all of the game logic out into another class since
  the game state's all localized into the seven fields (and leave the GUI
  handling where it is...) but I'm worried about the performance hit of calling
  across classes all the time.
