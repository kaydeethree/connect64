Android Assignment 3: Connect64

Checkstyle issues:
* Something something array initialization indents.
* this.localField is ok, but the Source Cleanup tool removes "this" on method
  calls defined in the Class. Checkstyle doesn't seem to care about methods
  defined in parent Classes that I'm calling without this, though... TBQH I
  don't see the need. 

Implementation notes:
* The solution I came up with storing puzzles is meh. 2-dimensional arrays are
  not efficient, but at least they only get accessed _once_ on puzzle creation.
  I'd store them as HashMaps (or SparseIntArrays on Android) if there was a
  better way to initialize them without having to iterate through the array to
  load them up anyway.
* It'd be nice if more Android-defined classes (like SparseIntArray) could be
  put in Bundles, but oh well.
* I've got a boatload of member fields this time around, most of which are
  static tags or references to Views. Only 6 actual state members...
* I keep wanting to factor game-logic handling methods out to separate
  classes, but there's a lot of state that most methods need to be aware of
  without passing around 38 arguments, However, most of the state is encoded in
  the boardState hashmap...
