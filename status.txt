Android Assignment 3: Connect64

Checkstyle issues:
* Something something array initialization indents.
* this.localField is ok, but the Source Cleanup tool removes "this" on method
  calls defined elsewhere in the Class, including those calls as part of an
  assignment operation. Checkstyle doesn't seem to care about methods defined
  in parent Classes or straight calls to class-defined methods though...
* It's also complaining about the 5 values I'm checking against in
  hasValidNeighbors(), (hasNext = 64 || up || down || left || right) but I
  don't want to break it up just to satisfy checkstyle as it's obvious what's
  going on.
* Interface-defined methods with >4 parameters aren't liked either, but there's
  nothing I can do about that.
* There's still one nested if. I'm leaving it in for efficiency reasons.



BIG BIG IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:


* I am using a library for the color picker. If it's not in the zip, it can be
  found at <http://code.google.com/p/android-color-picker/>. More info at 
  https://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject


Other implementation notes:
* Serialization/Parcelization is painful. I'm really curious to see how the
  rest of the class saves state in onPause(). Hopefully not in 64 prefs...
* I've got a boatload of member fields this time around, most of which are
  static tags or references to Views. Only 7 actual state members...
* Tablet-mode views are workable, but meh. Struggling to get the buttons to
  actually take up vertical space, not just increase the padding between them.
* My wow factor is the auto-fill-in feature, can be turned off in settings.
